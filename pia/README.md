# PIA Clothes selector
------------
## Brief explanation

My PIA is a multi-optional clothing selector that allows you to filter occasion specifications to give you the right outfit at the moment you are.The intention of this is to facilitate the selection of our outfits, because we do not always know what would be a good idea, and if you do not want to wear what my program recommends, at least you will have a broader idea of ​​what style you could wear

## How it works
1. Introduce your name 
1. Choose a season
1. Select gender and occasion. It will give you an outfit
1. If you agreed with the final result, colse the program, if you are not, do what it ask you to and see the other option prepared for you
1. Repeat or close.

### Menus and stuff

When you run the code, the first menu that comes out is the **menu to select the season**, the user must select one of the 5 options, number 5 being the exit of the program.
When selecting a season, it will open another menu where it will ask you the **occasion**, and the **gender**, that is, specify if you would like an outfit for a formal man, a casual woman, etc.
After selecting this, the program will return an option filtered by cases and the options you chose previously. In case you don't like the recommended option, the program will ask you if you agree with your selection, if you don't, it will throw you a new selection that you probably like more than the previous one.

## Options
There are 32 diferent combinations of clothes.

### SELF APPRAISAL
My program is very simple, but it fulfills all the required functionalities, it is organized due to the use of my comments and subroutines dividing the seasons, and I consider that there are no grammatical errors
