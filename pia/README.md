# PIA Clothes selector
------------
## Brief explanation

My PIA is a multi-optional clothing selector that allows you to filter occasion specifications to give you the right outfit at the moment you are.

## How it works
1. Introduce your name 
1. Choose a season
1. Select gender and occasion. It will give you an outfit
1. If you agreed with the final result, colse the program, if you are not, do what it ask you to and see the other option prepared for you
1. Repeat or close.

### Menus and stuff

When you run the code, the first menu that comes out is the **menu to select the season**, the user must select one of the 5 options, number 5 being the exit of the program.
When selecting a season, it will open another menu where it will ask you the **occasion**, and the **gender**, that is, specify if you would like an outfit for a formal man, a casual woman, etc.
After selecting this, the program will return an option filtered by cases and the options you chose previously. In case you don't like the recommended option, the program will ask you if you agree with your selection, if you don't, it will throw you a new selection that you probably like more than the previous one.

## Options
There are 32 diferent combinations of clothes, an I have the intention to make 64.


## Some future improvements
- Divide in functions 
- Transfer to a txt file 
- Better interface
- Add links to the final options that send you to an image in order to make it more visual

> There are some bugs to be fixed at adding a second name
