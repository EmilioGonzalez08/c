# PIA Clothes selector
------------
## Brief explanation

My PIA is a multi-optional clothing selector that allows you to filter occasion specifications to give you the right outfit at the moment you are.

## How it works
1. Introduce your name 
1. Choose a season
1.  Select gender and occasion
  - It will give you an option of an outfit
1. If you agreed with the final result, colse the program, if you are not, do what it ask you to and see the other option prepared for you
1. Repeat or close.

## Some future improvements
- Divide in functions 
- Transfer to a txt file 
- Better interface
- Add links to the final options that send you to an image in order to make it more visual

> There are some bugs to be fixed at adding a second name
